### Issue: 

I have a problem with 2 databases.
Since I created a second base with the last version of nuBuilder V4, I can no longer access to the first base.
When I want to access my first base, I'm with the second.
I checked with phpmyadmin the two databases exist.

### Fix: 

Not available!

### Workaround: 

Open each nuBuilder instance in another browser...
